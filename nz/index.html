        <h1>lake-tekapo</h1>
        <p>Lake Tekapo is the second-largest of three roughly parallel lakes running northâ€“south along the northern edge
            of the Mackenzie Basin in the South Island of New Zealand (the others are Lake Pukaki and Lake Ohau). It
            covers an area of 83 square kilometres (32 sq mi), and is at an altitude of 710 metres (2,330 ft) above sea
            level.

            The lake is fed at its northern end by the braided Godley River, which has its source in the Southern Alps
            to the north. The lake is a popular tourist destination, and several resort hotels are located at the
            township of Lake Tekapo at the lake's southern end. The Lake Tekapo Regional Park, administered by
            Environment Canterbury, is located on the southern shore of the lake.(Quelle:Wiipedia)
